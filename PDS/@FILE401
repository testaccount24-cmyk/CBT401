//*                                                                 *   FILE 401
//*      SPITBOL 360 is an implementation of the SNOBOL4            *   FILE 401
//*      programming language for use on IBM 360 compatible         *   FILE 401
//*      computers. SPITBOL is considerably smaller than the        *   FILE 401
//*      original implementation of SNOBOL4 and has execution       *   FILE 401
//*      speeds up to ten times faster. For certain programs,       *   FILE 401
//*      notably those with in-line patterns, the gain in speed     *   FILE 401
//*      may be even greater.                                       *   FILE 401
//*                                                                 *   FILE 401
//*      Unlike SIL SNOBOL4Ý**¨, which is an interpreter,           *   FILE 401
//*      SPITBOL is a true compiler which generates executable      *   FILE 401
//*      machine code. Of course, the complexity of the SNOBOL4     *   FILE 401
//*      language dictates that system subroutines be used for      *   FILE 401
//*      many common functions.                                     *   FILE 401
//*                                                                 *   FILE 401
//*      SPITBOL can be run as an 'in-core' 'load-and-go' system    *   FILE 401
//*      like WATFIV, where programs are executed as soon as they   *   FILE 401
//*      are compiled.  Alternately, the compiler can generate      *   FILE 401
//*      object modules that can be linked with a run-time          *   FILE 401
//*      library to create load modules for later execution.        *   FILE 401
